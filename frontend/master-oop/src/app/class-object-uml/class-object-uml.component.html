        <p class="poppins-medium">A class is a template that defines the characteristics and behaviours 
            of an object. An object can be anything, for example, a person, a car or a dog. Each object 
            has characteristics and behaviours that make the object unique. A class is a blueprint that 
            embeds these characteristics and behaviours into these objects to make them the objects they are.
