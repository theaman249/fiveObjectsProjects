            Inheritance
        </h1>

        <p class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (called a child class or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (i.e., attributes and methods) from another class (called a parent class or superclass).

            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"><b>Method Overriding </b> can be used to redefine a method in the child class that is inherited from the parent class, allowing for behaviour that meets the child class' specific needs</li>

            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Single Inheritance</b>: The most basic type of inheritance. A single child class inherits form a single parent class.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Hierarchical Inheritance</b>: Multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Multiple Inheritance</b>: A child class inherits from more than one parent class.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Multilevel Inheritance</b>: A class inherits from a superclass, and then another class inherits from that subclass. This forms a chain of inheritance. </li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Hybrid Inheritance</b>: is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It's called "hybrid" because it mixes various forms of inheritance to create a complex hierarchy. </li>
