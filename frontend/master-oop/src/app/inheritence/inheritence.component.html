            Inheritance

        <p class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (called a child class or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (i.e., attributes and methods) from another class (called a parent class or superclass).

            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Hierarchical Inheritance</b>: Multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Multiple Inheritance</b>: A child class inherits from more than one parent class.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Multilevel Inheritance</b>: A class inherits from a superclass, and then another class inherits from that subclass. This forms a chain of inheritance. </li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Hybrid Inheritance</b>: is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It's called "hybrid" because it mixes various forms of inheritance to create a complex hierarchy. </li>

            Let's say you have an Animal class that has attributes like species, colour and weight and behaviour such as eat. Animal acts as a parent class. Species, colour and weight are common attributes that all animals have and eat is a behaviour all animals have. A Dog is a type of Animal. A Dog class can inherit these attributes from the Animal class but might add specific attributes such as breed or specific behaviour such as bark. A Lion is also a type of Animal and has specific behaviour such as roar.

            Summary
        </h1>

        <ul class="list-disc">
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Child Class/SubClass</b>: A class that inherits attributes and methods from the parent class. </li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Parent Class/SuperClass</b>: A class whose attributes and methods are inherited by the child class. </li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> There are five types of inheritance: Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance, Hierarchical Inheritance, Hybrid Inheritance.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Method Overloading</b>: allows methods in the child class to perform similar but slightly different tasks from the parent class.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Reusability</b>: is the practice of designing and writing code in a way that allows it to be used again in different contexts without modification. </li>
        </ul>
